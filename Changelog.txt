v1.31
- Hotfix that fixes the stop button from not working correctly when playing back replays in ROA
- For ROA A button replaced with Start button as this results in faster menu navigation
	- If the navigation with A button was preferred simply bind it to your A button as the code for navigation remains the same

v1.3
- Now supports multiple games! Added support for Rivals of Aether
- Settings Menu added so that the default settings/keybindings can be changed without editing the config file
- All textboxes where a key is set are now tap to set. These textboxes can be cleared by right clicking on them.

v1.2
- New feature: Display Hitboxes/Inputs/Attack Data during playback
- Expose all your favourite players as mashers completely automatically!
- With this update, the config file has been changed to include keybinds for LP and MP as well as LK and Right. Please update the config file to reflect this in order to use this new feature.

v1.1
- Made it so that the program presses LK instead of LP
- Make the program actually press the buttons specified in the XML file instead of pressing A/right arrow key regardless (whoops :P)

v1.0
- First build released
